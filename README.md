# Whookie

Whookie is a server that sends batched events to subscribed urls, aka Webhooks. If you want to send webhooks from your app, then Whookie can help you out.

This library is designed to be used in an existing Go application. See [Whookie Server](https://github.com/snikch/whookie-server) for a standalone binary.

## Usage

```go
runner := whookie.NewRunner(time.Second)

â€¦

runner.Stop()
```
